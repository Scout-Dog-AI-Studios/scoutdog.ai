About Scout Dog AI Studios
Scout Dog AI Studios LLC is a boutique software development firm based in Windsor, California. We specialize in building lean, high-utility applications that leverage modern AI to solve real-world problems in the physical market.

Our mission is to create tools that help people identify, value, and preserve the items they care about. We believe that technology is at its best when it serves as a bridge between digital intelligence and the physical world—helping individuals uncover hidden value and fostering community-driven commerce.

Our Focus
Intelligent Valuation: Utilizing advanced vision models and grounding technology to provide instant, accurate market data for physical goods.

Specialized Marketplaces: Building community-centric platforms like Retro Swap Meet that facilitate the exchange of vintage gear and specialized equipment.

Lean Engineering: Operating as a solo-led studio allows us to prioritize depth, privacy, and precision in every line of code we ship.

The Philosophy
We don't build "AI for AI's sake." Every project under the Scout Dog banner is designed to be a practical, reliable assistant—a digital companion that helps users navigate complex physical markets with confidence.
