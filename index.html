    <h2>About the Studio</h2>
    <div class="about-content">
      <p>Scout Dog AI Studios LLC is a boutique software development firm based in Windsor, California. We specialize in building lean, high-utility applications that leverage modern AI to solve real-world problems in the physical market.</p>

      <p>Our mission is to create tools that help people identify, value, and preserve the items they care about. We believe that technology is at its best when it serves as a bridge between digital intelligence and the physical world.</p>

      <h3>Our Focus</h3>
      <ul class="focus-list">
        <li><strong>Intelligent Valuation:</strong> Utilizing advanced vision models and grounding technology to provide instant, accurate market data for physical goods.</li>
        <li><strong>Specialized Marketplaces:</strong> Building community-centric platforms that facilitate the exchange of vintage gear and specialized equipment.</li>
        <li><strong>Lean Engineering:</strong> Operating as a solo-led studio allows us to prioritize depth, privacy, and precision in every line of code we ship.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Philosophy</h3>
      <p>We don't build "AI for AI's sake." Every project under the Scout Dog banner is designed to be a practical, reliable assistant—a digital companion that helps users navigate complex physical markets with confidence.</p>
